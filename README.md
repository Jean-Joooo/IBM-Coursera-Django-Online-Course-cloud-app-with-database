IBM Coursera Full Stack courses - Project cloud app with database :

Welcome in one of my journey as IBM Full Stack Software Developer ! In this final project of my Django SQL & Databases classes, I had the exciting opportunity to enhance an online course app by introducing a brand-new assessment feature. This endeavor provided a platform to showcase my skills in development, deployment, and database management.

Project Structure and Development Environment
The project offered flexibility in development, allowing me to choose between Theia hosted by IBM Developer Skills Network or my local development environment. Whether crafting the project structure on Theia workspace or setting up a Python runtime and IDE locally, the choice was mine.

Development Highlights
Hints and guidance were strategically embedded in the source code files, providing insights and direction as I navigated through the project. This thoughtful approach ensured a meaningful learning experience while building the assessment feature.

Deployment Flexibility
The project allowed me to flex my deployment muscles by giving the freedom to choose any cloud platform. Although the default was IBM Cloud Foundry, I had the liberty to explore and deploy on a platform that resonated with my preferences and requirements.

Database Choices
To add a personalized touch, the project provided the flexibility to choose from various Django-supported SQL databases, including SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. This allowed me to align the database selection with the project's specific needs, tailoring the experience to perfection.

ER Diagram as a Guide
To facilitate a smooth development process, an ER diagram design was graciously provided. This visual representation served as a valuable reference, guiding me through the intricacies of integrating the new assessment feature seamlessly into the existing app. You could find it at the end of this readme file.

This IBM project has been a captivating journey of exploration, learning, and application. The freedom to choose development and deployment environments, coupled with the flexibility in database selection, added a layer of personalization to the experience.
