# Coursera | IBM Full Stack courses - Project Cloud App with Database :

In this final project of my Django SQL & Databases classes, I had the opportunity to enhance an online course app by introducing a brand-new assessment feature. This endeavor provided a platform to showcase my skills in development, deployment, and database management. To facilitate a smooth development process, an ER diagram design was graciously provided. This visual representation served as a valuable reference, guiding me through the intricacies of integrating the new assessment feature seamlessly into the existing app.
